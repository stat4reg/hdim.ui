Description: This package allows you to derive uncertainty intervals for average of a variable with missing values or some causal parameters in an observational study including the average causal effect (ACE) or the average causal effect on the treated (ACT). It uses a regression imputation estimator and a doubly robust estimator. The uncertainty intervals can be used as a sensitivity analysis to unconfoundedness. Look at the manual for the main functions ui_causal and ui_missing for description and examples.
